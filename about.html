    const bioText = `
Chief Babatunde Odunlade was born into a family of deep tradition and strong values in Ibadan, Nigeria. 
From a young age, his curiosity and discipline marked him out as a natural leader ‚Äî one who blended wisdom with compassion.

He pursued education with focus and later built a distinguished career marked by integrity, creativity, and service to his people. 
Beyond his professional excellence, he was known for his laughter, his stories, and his quiet strength that inspired many.

In his community, Baba Odunlade was more than a leader ‚Äî he was a mentor, a bridge-builder, and a voice of reason in challenging times. 
His generosity reached far beyond his family, touching countless lives through acts of kindness and mentorship.

He is survived by his beloved wife, children, grandchildren, and many whose paths were shaped by his love and example.
His life reminds us that greatness is not in what we gather, but in what we give.
